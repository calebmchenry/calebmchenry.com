Hello World! The exclamation of new beginnings. 

I recently posted [my first YouTube vide](https://youtu.be/q2w259RAPxw). And this is the birth of my personal website. This is a time of new beginnings for me. I've always had a love for learning and teaching. I hope to be able to use this website and other mediums to help myself grow as a software developer. And if I am lucky perhaps it will inspire you too.

I hope to produce content about all things web development. And give my audience a glimpse into things I learn, mistakes I've made, and new languages playing with.
